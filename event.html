                    excitement.
                    As the corona virus pandemic plunged everyone into despair and locked at homes, the pressure of not
                    letting virtual interaction a barrier in the functioning of the society developed and hence it
                    became <span id="dots">...</span> <span id="more">
                        requisite for the core- team to switch gears and expand its horizons in terms of creativity and
                        hard
                        work. Regular webinars such as ‘How to cope with mental
                        health during COVID-19 pandemic’, ‘Guide to
                        career opportunities in Chemistry’ etc. featuring esteemed speakers were conducted to help
                        students
                        maximize their knowledge and explore the more interesting sides of Chemistry. The Journal of
                        Rasayanatva
                        is one of the most noteworthy achievement in the previous year. The journal encapsulates review
                        articles
                        on the researches performed by the scientists from the wide spectrum of Chemistry. Instagram
                        series
                        ‘Factophile’ representing a blend of learning and fun through thought-provoking posts is another
                        initiative taken mainly to increase the social media outreach. To impart wisdom and scale the
                        scientific
                        interests in students we also organized a national conference on ‘New frontiers in Biosensing’
                        where
                        renowned guest speakers from the field of Chemistry addressed the forum. The Chemical Society
                        bid
                        farewell to the students of batch of 2021 in the month of May and wished them luck for future.
                        We
                        also
                        released the seventh edition of our annual magazine called ‘Equilibrium’ this year. The session
                        2020-21
                        brought many unprecedented challenges but the overwhelming participation we received in our
                        every
                        endeavor inspired us to not settle. It truly has been a remarkable session. It is our greatest
                        honor
                        to
                        serve you all and we will continue to strive for excellence.</span></p>
