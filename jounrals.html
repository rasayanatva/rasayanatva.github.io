                <p class="">Hope you all are healthy and safe. We are honoured that you have picked our journal
                    to read. As a student of B.Sc. Honours in Chemistry from Hansraj College, one could expect a rat
                    race competition omnipresent in the institution owing to the brightest minds from all over the
                    country. We embrace the diversity, share ideas, cultures, and also some typical stigmatisation.
                    The acknowledgement of the students on Chemistry being peripheralized to textbooks with little
                    relevance in advances, technology and everyday life is the biggest sceptical thought that
                    prevails. Another factor reflecting the delusionality among the majority of students is cynicism
                    to the subject they have chosen to pursue for graduation.
                    ​
                    Disturbed to know the belief among the students that only being inclined to academics with no
                    knowledge out of the sphere and latching to the comfort zone is enough while few others who lack
                    the knowledge to access the scientific developments by their own and yet another category of
                    students who give up on being jargonised by the research papers, we at Rasayanatva, The Chemical
                    Society of Hansraj College came up with the thought to equip the students with scientific
                    inventions and advancements from every field of Chemistry, about the researchers conducted or
                    happening and the honourable scientists, in a clear, lucid and simplified way. We believe, this
                    will preserve or foster the enthusiasm within students about the subject which has so much to
                    offer and they might not know.
                    ​
                    Rasayanatva has enlisted few visions. When in 2020, for the first time, we hosted a National
                    Seminar featuring renowned scientists and providing a platform between them and students to
                    exchange the thoughts on Environmental Sustainability, the idea to begin with a scientific
                    journal strike. Due to non-existence of proper planning and orientation the idea postponed and
                    after few months, we, paired with a very hardworking junior team mustered up the strength to
                    launch our very first journal this year. It has been months that our team has been doing
                    research and gathering the ethical data on the invariant topics centred on Chemistry. 
                     
                    This journal is an effort and tool to boost your confidence that might have been belittled, to
                    discover the wealth of wisdom, to enrich the quality of your life, to bring the more of yourself
                    into your work and to discover your calling. Since it is our very first issue of the journal, we
                    would love your suggestions or any improvements you feel mentionable. <strong>You could email to us

                <p class="lead"> Being a student of chemistry has always fascinated us because unlike other subjects,
                    where the object of
                    study can be seen or observed, we enjoy no such powers. We work on molecular and atomic levels
                    without
                    seeing them. Their essence can only be felt and enjoyed making it one of the toughest subject to
                    work
                    with. Yet it attracts thousands of people towards itself because of its tremendous power to change
                    the
                    world. The atomic bomb that changed the course of history, the nuclear power plants which
                    revolutionized
                    the electricity supply, the plethora number of medicines which has advanced the medical field and
                    what
                    not. Right from cosmetics to the cosmos, everything has a chemistry of its own. The list of
                    achievements
                    of chemistry is a never ending one.
                    ​
                    It has been almost a year and struggle with this pandemic is still not over. Scientists, researchers
                    and
                    scholars are all aiming towards the development of vaccine to curb this pandemic and their only ray
                    of
                    hope is an integrated approach in fields of biomedicine using biochemistry and cheminformatics. The
                    way
                    these research applications are revolutionizing this field gives everyone a hope that it is for sure
                    possible to curb this pandemic.
                    ​
                    These achievements come from a scientific temperament which develops gradually over years and as a
                    result of acquiring knowledge related it. The Chemical Journal of Rasayanatva helps the students to
                    foster in them this scientific rationale in their formative years. This journal is an initiative to
                    do
                    so.  It is the first time that any college society is launching their own journal so we hope to get
                    immense love from all our readers. We welcome all constrictive criticism regarding this journal.

                <p class="">Salut beautiful readers!
                    “Modern Chemistry with its far-reaching generalizations and hypothesis is a fine example of how the
                    human mind can go in exploring the unknown beyond the limits of human senses.”
                    ~ Horace G. Deming
                    Being the students of Chemistry, we can staunchly vouch for the aforesaid quote. The consequences of
                    Chemistry are patently comprehensive!
                    Chemistry isn’t something that is merely confided to a laboratory, it’s something that is within
                    you.
                    From its essential contributions to humanity in food and medicines, clothes and housing, energy and
                    raw
                    materials to its breakthrough publication of the genetic code for SARS- CoV-2, its omnipresence
                    cannot
                    be gainsaid.
                    This website is Rasayanatva’s passion project to satiate your mind with an eclectic range of topics
                    of
